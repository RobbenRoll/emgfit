Feel free to copy the tutorial folder to a different directory (outside of the `emgfit/` directory!) and follow along with the tutorial by actually running the code. You can also use this notebook as a template for your own analyses (consider removing some of the explanations). It is recommended to use a separate notebook for each spectrum to be fitted. This enables you to go back to the notebook at any time and check on all the details of how the fits were performed. \n",

    "emgfit is optimized to be run within Jupyter Notebooks. There is dozens of decent introductions to using Jupyter Notebooks, a nice overview can e.g. be found at https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/. Naturally, the first step of an analysis with emgfit is starting up your notebook server by running ``jupyter notebook`` in your command-line interface. This should automatically make the Jupyter interface pop up in a browser window. From there you can navigate to different directories and create a new notebook (`new` panel on the top right) or open an existing notebook (.ipynb files)."

The list must have the same length as the number of peaks associated with the spectrum object. If there are peaks whose labels should not be changed (e.g. unidentified peaks), simply insert ``None`` as a placeholder at the corresponding spots (as done for peaks 2 and 7 below). The syntax for species labels follows the [:-notation](concepts.rst#notation-of-chemical-substances). **It is important not to forget to subtract the number of electrons corresponding to the ion's charge state!** Otherwise the analysis would mistakenly proceed with the atomic instead of the ionic mass. Note that currently only singly charged species are supported by emgfit. Tentative peak identifications can be indicated by adding a ``'?'`` to the end of the species string. In this case the literature values are not fetched. The user can also define custom literature values (e.g. to handle isomers or if there are recent measurements that have not entered the AME yet).
